			<h1><i><center>Welcome to Fourth-Grade Science!</center></i></h1>
			<p><strong><em>I am so excited to be your fourth-grade science teacher this year at Salem Elementary!</em></strong>  Weâ€™ll be learning a lot this year.  This website will serve as a location for information about all of the things we will be learning about and things going on in our class, including various hands-on classroom activities, experiments, and projects.  You will also find a list of fun facts and trivia to keep you thinking and curious, as well as a list of links to various websites and online resources we will be frequently using.  We should hopefully have a lot of fun this year!</p>
			<p>Parents, I want you to love your children being in my classroom, and to know that I am always giving them my best.  You can also use this website to keep up with what your child is learning about in class.  I will keep you informed of things we are working on and any current events on the Projects page.  Be sure to keep a look out for updates to stay in the know.  If you ever need to get in touch with me, you can contact me via the contact information on the About page.</p>
